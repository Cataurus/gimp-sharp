This sample plug-in is the porting to Java of the Average C# plug-in.

It can be considered as reference how the typical C# constructs used
in the existant C# plug-ins can be used in Java / IKVM environment.

To test this plug-in, just copy it in the plug-ins directory and
change the makefile scripts to build it too.

In order to enable the Java / IKVM framework, the "--with-java" flag
needs to be included when the "configure" command is issued.
