JAverageBlur
-------------

This sample plug-in is the porting to Java of the Average Blur C# plug-in.

It can be considered as reference how the typical C# constructs used
in the existant C# plug-ins can be used in Java / IKVM environment.

To test this plug-in, just copy it in the plug-ins directory and
change the makefile scripts to build it too (for example configure.in in the root directory).

In order to enable the Java / IKVM framework, the "--with-java" flag
needs to be included when the "configure" command is issued.


Some notes about Mono 1.2.x and IKVM 0.30.0.0
----------------------------------------------

IKVM is assumed to be installed in $(MONO_DIR)/../lib/ikvm .
Using IKVM 0.30.0.0 (last version tested), it's required to set the MONO_PATH global variable to the IKVM path to find the runtime DLLs.
