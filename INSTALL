To install Gimp# you will need Mono. Right now there is only a
simple Makefile provided. At the top of this Makefile you can choose
between Gimp 2.0 and Gimp 2.2. I have only tested my code with Gimp
2.1.x. Please report back if there are any issues with using Gimp# and
Gimp 2.0.

At the moment Gimp# will install 3 plug-ins for you:

/Filters/Artistic/Ministeck
/Filters/Render/NCP
/Filters/Render/Picture Package
