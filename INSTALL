To install Gimp# you will need Mono. Gimp# will work with GIMP 2.2
and GIMP 2.3.x.

Building Gimp# is easy:

1) unpack the archive
2) $ cd gimp-sharp-0.8
3) $ ./configure
4) $ make
5) become root
6) $ make install

Note: configure has the option --with-unittest which will build the
UnitTest plug-in.

The files will be installed in your GIMP plug-in directory, for
example in /usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/

At the moment Gimp# will install 6 plug-ins for you:

/Xtns/Picture Package
/Filters/Artistic/Ministeck
/Filters/Render/NCP
/Filters/Render/Splitter
/Filters/Render/Swirlies
/Filters/Web/Slice Tool

You will also get plug-ins to read wbmp (wireless bitmap) and
KoaloaPaint (old CBM64 format) files.
